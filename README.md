Here I'm learning how to create a decentralised exchange using solidity/hardhat for the backend and react for the frontend.

It's deployed on the rinkeby test network and can be seen here - https://dex-flame.vercel.app/

The user can swap between rinkeby eth and the crypto dev token that was created in the ICO project. 

The user can also add liqudity and get LP tokens in return.
